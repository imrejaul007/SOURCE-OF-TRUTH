# REZ Ecosystem - Master Security & Architecture Audit
**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** WAVE 2 COMPLETE (second audit pass resolved 15 additional issues across wallet, order, payment, merchant, and vesper-app — 2026-04-28)
**Services Audited:** auth, merchant, order, payment, wallet, gamification, media-events, catalog, gateway, consumer-app, admin-app, vesper-app, intent-graph, backend-monolith

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A comprehensive audit of 14 services across the REZ ecosystem identified **100+ issues** ranging from critical security vulnerabilities to medium-priority code quality improvements. The most critical finding is that **production secrets are committed to git** across multiple services. The most dangerous architectural finding is that **rez-intent-graph has zero authentication on 15+ endpoints**.

### Critical Issues (C1-C19)

| ID | Description | Status | PR / Notes |
|----|-----------|--------|-------|
| C1 | Production Secrets Committed to Git | ❌ Manual | Requires git history rewrite + credential rotation — cannot be auto-fixed |
| C2 | intent-graph: Zero Auth on 15+ Endpoints | ✅ Fixed | `verifyInternalToken` applied to all intent, commerce-memory, and chat routes |
| C3 | intent-graph: Autonomous Endpoints Unprotected | ✅ Fixed | autonomous.routes.ts refactored; auth on agent endpoints verified |

| C16 | auth-service: UUID Package Should Be Removed | ✅ Fixed | `uuid` not in package.json dependencies — already removed (#21) |
| C17 | auth-service: OTP_TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY Missing in Prod | ❌ Manual | Must be configured in Render dashboard env vars — not a code fix |
| C18 | auth-service: render.yaml Exposes OTP in Prod | ✅ Fixed | `NODE_ENV=production` + `EXPOSE_DEV_OTP="false"` already in render.yaml |
| C19 | auth-service: Legacy Single Token Instead of Scoped | ⚠️ Partial | Code supports `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKENS_JSON`; legacy token still in `.env` |

|----|-----------|--------|-------|
| M1 | Inconsistent Error Responses | ⚠️ Partial | `errorResponse.ts` created in auth, merchant, order, payment services — utilities available for adoption |
| M4 | autoIndex Not Disabled in Staging | ✅ Fixed | order-service mongodb.ts: `autoIndex` and `autoCreate` guarded with `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`; merchant/wallet already done |
| M5 | Silent Audit Log Failures | ✅ Fixed | `.catch(() => {})` replaced with logger.error/warn in merchant auth/orders/cashback, payment shutdown, wallet redis/transaction (#49, #36, #26) |
| M6 | N+1 Queries in Reconciliation | ✅ Fixed | `findBalanceMismatches` now uses single `$in` aggregate instead of one query per wallet; Promise.all parallelization in full report |
| M7 | Redis Pipelining Not Used in Auth | ⚠️ Partial | auth-service rate limiter uses pipelining |
| M8 | No OpenTelemetry Integration | ✅ Fixed | OTel SDK + tracing.ts added to auth, merchant, order, payment, wallet (#23, #44, #28, #32, #22) |
| M9 | No Prometheus Alerting Rules | ✅ Fixed | `prometheus-alerts.yml` created in SOURCE-OF-TRUTH |
| M10 | DLQ Bulk Retry Has No Concurrency Limit | ✅ Fixed | payment-service dlqAdmin.ts: retry jobs in batches of 10 instead of unbounded Promise.all (#38) |
| M11 | In-Memory Rate Limiter in Catalog | ✅ Fixed | catalog-service already uses Redis sorted-set sliding window rate limiting |
| M12 | Inconsistent Health Check Endpoints | ⚠️ Partial | order uses `/ready` vs `/health/ready`; M23 mounted dedicated health router |
| M13 | Deprecated Code Not Deleted | ✅ Fixed | `walletCreditWorker.ts` does not exist in wallet-service |
| M14 | MongoDB Connection Pool Too Small | ✅ Fixed | order-service: pool size 10→50, `poolTimeoutMS: 10000` added; wallet already had 50 (#33) |
| M15 | Shared Redis Instance for BullMQ + App | ✅ Fixed | order-service: workerRedis dedicated for BullMQ; bullmqRedis for app ops (#34) |
| M16 | Lock TTL Too Short — 30s | ✅ Fixed | order-service httpServer.ts: lock TTL increased from `EX', 30, 'NX'` to `EX', 60, 'NX'` (#33) |
| M17 | SSE Endpoint No Connection Limits | ✅ Fixed | order-service httpServer.ts: Redis-based tracking, max 10/merchant, 1000 global (#34) |
| M18 | Express urlencoded Without Explicit Limit | ✅ Fixed | payment-service index.ts: `limit: '100kb'` added to `express.urlencoded()` to prevent payload bomb attacks (#36) |
| M19 | Balance Cache TTL Too Long — 5min | ✅ Fixed | walletService.ts: `BALANCE_CACHE_TTL` reduced from 300s (5 min) to 60s to limit stale balance exposure during concurrent transaction races |
| M20 | Enum Mismatch: Zod vs Mongoose | ✅ Fixed | payment-service: Zod enums aligned with Mongoose model — paymentMethod and purpose match (#39) |
| M21 | Unvalidated deliveryAddress Object | ✅ Fixed | `validateDeliveryAddress()` added to httpServer.ts: limits keys (≤20), key length (≤100), string length (≤500), rejects arrays and nested arrays (#33) |
| M22 | profileIntegration setTimeout vs AbortController | ✅ Fixed | Both payment and order services correctly use AbortController with setTimeout to trigger abort after 5s timeout |
| M23 | Dead Code: health.ts Router Not Mounted | ✅ Fixed | wallet-service index.ts now mounts `healthRouter` at `/health`; inline handlers removed; `INTERNAL_SERVICE_HMAC_SECRET` added to render.yaml |

### Low Priority Issues (L1-L20)

| ID | Description | Status | PR / Notes |
|----|-----------|--------|-------|
| L1 | No API Versioning | ❌ Pending | All services lack /v1 prefix |
| L2 | No JSDoc Comments | ✅ Fixed | JSDoc added to key functions across 8 services (#26, #47, #31, #35, #25, #20, #8, #16) |
| L3 | No SameSite Cookie Enforcement | ✅ Fixed | merchant auth.ts already uses `sameSite: 'strict'` on all cookie options |
| L4 | Inconsistent createServiceLogger Usage | ⚠️ Partial | wallet logger usage reviewed; logger imported and used consistently across critical paths |
| L5 | Credit Score Cache No LRU Eviction | ✅ Fixed | wallet-service creditScore.ts: added MAX_CACHE_SIZE=1000 with LRU eviction when capacity reached (#27) |
| L6 | Dual Route Mounting for Compat | ✅ Fixed | wallet dual mount at `/` is intentional for backward compat; payoutRoutes and creditScoreRoutes use absolute paths with no conflicts |
| L7 | @livez Endpoint Returns OK Regardless | ⚠️ Acceptable | Liveness probes intentionally don't verify DB — Kubernetes uses `/health/live` for crash detection, not readiness |
| L8 | Metrics Reset on Pod Restart | ⚠️ By Design | In-memory metrics are acceptable for ephemeral counters; long-term trends need dedicated observability platform |
| L9 | Merchantpayouts Indexes Created on Every Startup | ✅ Fixed | merchantpayouts index creation guarded to `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` in wallet mongodb.ts (#26) |
| L10 | Global Error Handler Missing CORS Headers | ✅ Fixed | wallet-service index.ts: global error handler now sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` before sending error response (#26) |
| L11 | Missing .env.example Files | ✅ Fixed | Already existed for consumer-app, admin-app; vesper-app had one (#25) |
| L12 | package.json main Field Mismatch | ❌ Pending | backend-monolith main field mismatch |
| L13 | 80+ Seed Scripts at Root | ❌ Pending | backend-monolith seed scripts unchanged |
| L14 | 40+ Dependency Overrides | ❌ Pending | consumer-app dependency overrides unchanged |
| L15 | preinstall Script Could Execute Arbitrary Code | ❌ Pending | consumer-app preinstall script unverified |
| L16 | Hardcoded api.vesper.club Fallback URL | ✅ Fixed | vesper-app `src/constants/api.ts`: removed hardcoded `https://api.vesper.club` fallback; dev fallback is now `http://localhost:4000/api/v1` — app fails fast if `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is not set |
| L17 | Intent Graph Swarm No Graceful Shutdown | ❌ Pending | intent-graph swarm graceful shutdown not implemented |
| L18 | Unused @rez/shared-types in nextabizz | ✅ Fixed | nextabizz does not use `@rez/shared-types` — package not imported |
| L19 | No .nvmrc Files | ✅ Fixed | `.nvmrc` with `20` added to auth, merchant, order, payment, wallet (#25, #46, #30, #34, #24) |

## CROSS-SERVICE ISSUES (Found Across Multiple Services)

### Authentication Chaos
| Service | Auth Strategy | Token Comparison | Severity |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| rez-auth | JWT + bcrypt | `jwt.verify()` | Low |
| rez-merchant | JWT + HMAC | `timingSafeEqual` | Medium |
| rez-order | HMAC-SHA256 | `timingSafeEqual` (but self-referential key) | **Critical** |
| rez-payment | HMAC | `timingSafeEqual` | Medium |
| rez-wallet | JWT + HMAC | `timingSafeEqual` | Low |
| rez-gamification | HMAC-SHA256 | `timingSafeEqual` | Medium |
| rez-media-events | HMAC-SHA256 | `timingSafeEqual` | Medium |
| rez-catalog | HMAC | `timingSafeEqual` | Medium |
| rez-intent-graph | **NONE** | `===` (plain string) | **CRITICAL** |

### Committed Secrets
- `.env` files with production credentials committed in: **merchant, order, payment, wallet**
- `.env.example` files with default tokens shared across 3+ services

### Dependency Issues
- `typescript` and `@types/*` in `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`) in: **merchant, order, payment, wallet**
- GitHub fork for shared types in consumer app
- Local `file:` path refs for shared package in admin app

### Env Validation
- Duplicate env validation (Zod in `env.ts` + manual in `index.ts`) in: **merchant, order, payment, wallet**
- Dead code env validation (Zod schema defined but never imported) in: **order**

### Internal Auth Patterns
- 3+ different HMAC patterns across services (self-referential key, JSON-scoped tokens, legacy fallback)
- No standardized internal service auth across ecosystem

### C13: rez-auth-service — MFA Setup Exposes Raw TOTP Secret
**File:** `rez-auth-service/src/routes/mfaRoutes.ts:106`
**Risk:** Raw TOTP base32 secret returned in response — unnecessary attack surface
**Fix:** Remove `secret: rawSecret` from response, only return `keyUri`

### C14: rez-auth-service — OAuth Client Secret Uses `!==` Not Timing-Safe
**File:** `rez-auth-service/src/routes/oauthPartnerRoutes.ts:386, 526, 596`
**Risk:** Side-channel timing attack on OAuth client secrets
**Fix:** Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual` for all secret comparisons

### C15: rez-auth-service — `/auth/validate` Token Logic Fragile
**File:** `rez-auth-service/src/routes/authRoutes.ts:729-746`
**Risk:** Relies on `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` being absent to prevent userId leak — fragile
**Fix:** Explicitly check scoped tokens first, return generic `{ valid: boolean }` without additional info

### C16: rez-auth-service — UUID Package Should Be Removed
**File:** `rez-auth-service/package.json`
**Risk:** `uuid` v14 is a large package; `crypto.randomUUID()` is built into Node.js 14.17+
**Fix:** Remove `uuid` from dependencies, replace all `{ v4 as uuidv4 }` from 'uuid' with `crypto.randomUUID()`

### C17: rez-auth-service — OTP_TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY Missing in Production
**File:** `rez-auth-service/.env`
**Risk:** MFA likely broken in production — TOTP encryption key not configured
**Fix:** Generate and configure `OTP_TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in production

### C18: rez-auth-service — render.yaml Exposes OTP in Production
**File:** `rez-auth-service/render.yaml:10-12`
**Code:** `NODE_ENV=development` + `EXPOSE_DEV_OTP=true`
**Risk:** OTP codes logged in production Render deployment
**Fix:** Set `NODE_ENV=production` and `EXPOSE_DEV_OTP="false"` in render.yaml

### C19: rez-auth-service — Legacy Single Token Instead of Scoped Tokens
**File:** `rez-auth-service/.env`
**Risk:** Shared `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` means breach of any service exposes full internal auth
**Fix:** Migrate to `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKENS_JSON` with per-service unique tokens

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)

### C1: Production Secrets Committed to Git (Cross-Service)
**Affected:** merchant, order, payment, wallet
**Risk:** Active data breach — MongoDB passwords, JWT secrets, Sentry DSNs, Redis credentials exposed
**Fix:**
```bash
# Check git history for .env files
git log --all --oneline -- .env
# Rotate ALL exposed credentials immediately
# Add to .gitignore if not present
```

### C2: rez-intent-graph — Zero Auth on 15+ Endpoints
**File:** `rez-intent-graph/src/api/intent.routes.ts`
**Risk:** Anyone can read/write ALL user intent data, dormant intents, nudge history, merchant demand signals
**Endpoints affected:** `/api/intent/capture`, `/api/intent/active/:userId`, `/api/intent/user/:userId`, `/api/intent/dormant/:userId`, `/api/intent/profile/:userId`, `/api/intent/enriched/:userId`, `/api/intent/affinities/:userId`, and more
**Fix:** Add `verifyInternalToken` middleware to ALL endpoints

### C3: rez-intent-graph — Autonomous Endpoints Unprotected
**File:** `rez-intent-graph/src/api/autonomous.routes.ts`
**Risk:** `/api/autonomous/start`, `/api/autonomous/action`, `/api/autonomous/emergency-stop` are completely unauthenticated
**Fix:** Require internal service token AND network isolation

### C4: rez-intent-graph — Weak Token Comparison
**File:** `rez-intent-graph/src/middleware/auth.ts:14`
**Code:** `if (internalToken && token && internalToken === token)`
**Risk:** Vulnerable to timing attacks, not constant-time
**Fix:** Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(internalToken), Buffer.from(token))`

### C5: rez-order-service — Self-Referential HMAC Key
**File:** `rez-order-service/src/middleware/internalAuth.ts:49`
**Code:** `const hmacKey = Buffer.from(legacyToken || JSON.stringify(scopedTokens), 'utf8');`
**Risk:** HMAC verification degenerates to self-referential check — attacker with token can forge any token
**Fix:** Use independent `INTERNAL_SERVICE_HMAC_SECRET` env var

### C6: rez-merchant-service — OTP Stored as Plaintext in Redis
**File:** `rez-merchant-service/src/routes/auth.ts`
**Risk:** Anyone with Redis access can read OTPs
**Fix:** Store bcrypt hash of OTP, compare with timing-safe equality

### C7: rez-merchant-service — HMAC Truncated to 64 Bits for QR Codes
**File:** `rez-merchant-service/src/utils/qrGenerator.ts:28-36`
**Code:** `.slice(0, 16)` of HMAC-SHA256 output
**Risk:** Only 64 bits of HMAC for fraud-critical karma check-in
**Fix:** Use full 32-byte HMAC output (64 hex chars) or at minimum 256 bits

### C8: rez-intent-graph — Math.random() for ID Generation
**File:** `rez-intent-graph/src/services/external-services.ts` (multiple locations)
**Risk:** Predictable IDs for financial operations
**Fix:** Replace with `crypto.randomUUID()`

### C9: rez-order-service — Broken JWT Verification
**File:** `rez-order-service/src/httpServer.ts:171-188`
**Risk:** Uses HMAC-SHA256 to verify JWTs — won't work with RS256 tokens
**Fix:** Determine auth algorithm, use RSA public key for RS256, add `alg` field validation

### C10: rez-payment-service — No Rate Limiting
**File:** `rez-payment-service/src/routes/paymentRoutes.ts`
**Risk:** Unmetered access to payment initiation, capture, refund endpoints
**Fix:** Add `express-rate-limit` with Redis backend

### C11: rez-merchant-service — RBAC Defined But Never Enforced
**File:** `rez-merchant-service/src/routes/` (bulk-actions, payouts, payroll)
**Risk:** `merchantPermissions` extracted from JWT but never checked
**Fix:** Add permission checks on all sensitive routes

### C12: rez-wallet-service — Committed .env Backup File
**File:** `rez-wallet-service/.env.bak-20260411-114037`
**Risk:** Backup of production secrets committed to git
**Fix:** Remove immediately, add `*.bak*` to .gitignore

## HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### H1: Test Coverage Near Zero on Financial Services
**Affected:** wallet, merchant, order, payment
**Details:**
- wallet-service: 2 test files, ~216 lines (financial service with NO tests for credit/debit)
- merchant-service: 5 test files for 93+ routes
- order-service: Only schema tests, no HTTP handler tests
- payment-service: Test config mismatch (Jest vs node --test)

### H2: RBAC Never Enforced
**Affected:** merchant, wallet
**Details:** `merchantPermissions` extracted but never checked on bulk-actions, payouts, payroll

### H3: IDOR Vulnerability
**Affected:** merchant, payment
**Details:** Some routes only check store ownership, not merchantId ownership — cross-tenant leak possible

### H4: Hardcoded Production URLs
**Affected:** intent-graph (Render.com URLs in `services.ts`), gateway (localhost fallbacks)
**Risk:** Source code contains production service URLs

### H5: Supply Chain Risk
**Affected:** consumer-app
**Details:** `@rez/shared-types` from GitHub fork (uncontrolled), admin-app from `file:../rez-shared` (won't work published)

### H6: BNPL Has Localhost Fallback
**Affected:** payment-service
**Code:** `process.env.WALLET_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:4004'`
**Risk:** Misconfigured BNPL hits unintended local service

### H7: Missing DB Indexes
**Affected:** order (no merchant index), merchant (no orderNumber unique index)
**Risk:** Full collection scans on large tables

### H8: MongoDB Transactions Missing
**Affected:** order, payment
**Details:** Multi-document operations not wrapped in transactions — data inconsistency risk

### H9: Circuit Breaker Pattern Missing
**Affected:** order, payment, wallet, catalog
**Details:** Manual timeouts only, no proper half-open/closed/open states

### H10: Unused Zod Schemas
**Affected:** order (schemas defined but not wired), catalog (schemas exist but inconsistent usage)
**Risk:** Two sources of truth for validation

### H11: @types/* in Dependencies
**Affected:** merchant, order, payment, wallet
**Risk:** Bloats production Docker images

### H12: Redis Fail-Open/Close Issues
**Affected:** order (fails open in dev), gamification (fails closed — availability risk), wallet (fails closed)

### H13: Zod Version Mismatch
**Affected:** admin-app (v4), catalog (v3)
**Risk:** Incompatible schema sharing between frontend and backend

### H14: Shared Types Divergence
**Affected:** consumer-app (GitHub fork), admin-app (local path), backend (@rez/shared)
**Risk:** Three different sources for same types

### H15: No npm audit in CI
**Affected:** All services
**Risk:** Unknown CVE exposure

3. Fix intent-graph autonomous endpoints (C3) — ✅ **Fixed** — auth on agent endpoints
4. Add rate limiting to payment-service (C10) — ✅ **Fixed** — rateLimiter.ts with 3 tiers
5. Add rate limiting to intent-graph (M9/M11) — ✅ **Fixed** — rateLimit.ts with 2 tiers

## PENDING WORK (Priority Order)

### Must Fix Before Production
1. **C1**: Rotate ALL committed secrets in merchant, order, payment, wallet — critical breach risk
2. **C6**: Encrypt OTP storage in merchant-service — plaintext OTPs in Redis
3. **C9**: Fix order-service JWT verification — RS256 tokens will always fail
4. **C11**: Enforce RBAC on merchant bulk-actions, payouts, payroll — permissions extracted but not checked
5. **C12**: Remove wallet .env.bak file from git
6. **C17**: Configure OTP_TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY in auth-service production
7. **C18**: Fix render.yaml NODE_ENV=development in auth-service

### Should Fix Before Next Release
8. **H1**: Add test coverage to financial services (wallet, merchant, order, payment)
9. **H3**: Fix IDOR vulnerabilities in merchant and payment routes
10. **H6**: Remove BNPL localhost fallback in payment-service
11. **H7**: Add missing database indexes
12. **H9**: Implement proper circuit breakers with half-open/closed/open states
13. **C7**: Use full HMAC output for merchant QR codes — 64-bit truncation too weak
14. **C8**: Replace remaining Math.random() in intent-graph — 6 template selection locations
15. **M4**: Disable autoIndex in staging — index creation on every startup

### Schedule for Technical Debt Sprint
16. Cursor-based pagination across all services
17. Zod version unification (admin-app v4, catalog v3)
18. Shared types publishing (@rez/shared-types to npm)
19. MongoDB transaction wrapping for multi-document operations
20. Redis pipelining in merchant-service auth middleware
