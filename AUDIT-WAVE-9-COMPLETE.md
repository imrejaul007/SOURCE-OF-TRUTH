## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify rate limiting
grep -n "Limiter" rez-wallet-service/src/index.ts

# Verify no hardcoded URLs
grep -rn "onrender.com" --include="*.ts" . | grep -v node_modules

# Verify unified auth
grep "internalAuth" rez-shared/src/middleware/index.ts

# Verify fail-closed
grep -n "return false" rez-catalog-service/src/httpServer.ts

# Verify correlation ID support
grep -n "correlationId\|traceparent" rez-shared/src/utils/logger.ts
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Kong Gateway** - Replace/augment nginx gateway
2. **mTLS for Internal Services** - Certificate infrastructure needed
3. **Centralized Logging Aggregation** - ELK/Datadog integration
4. **DDoS Protection** - Cloudflare/AWS Shield
